The main job of an Operations Specialist (OS) in the Navy is to collect, process, display, and disseminate tactical combat information to command and control stations, upon which sound tactical decisions may be made. OSs work in the Combat Information Center (CIC) or Combat Direction Center (CDC), which is the tactical nerve center of the ship.

OSs use a wide variety of assets to gather information, including radar, sonar, and electronic intelligence systems. They then plot and track the movements of all friendly and enemy forces in the area, as well as potential hazards such as weather and mines. OSs also use their knowledge of naval tactics and procedures to assess the tactical situation and make recommendations to their superiors.

Here are some of the specific duties of an Operations Specialist:

* Plot and track the ship's position, heading, and speed
* Operate and maintain radar, sonar, and other electronic navigation equipment
* Identify and classify potential contacts
* Interpret radar presentations and evaluate tactical situations
* Make recommendations to superiors on how to respond to potential threats
* Communicate with other ships and aircraft in the area
* Coordinate the ship's defensive and offensive operations

Operations Specialists play a vital role in the Navy's mission to protect the United States and its interests around the world. They are highly trained and skilled professionals who are responsible for some of the most critical tasks on a warship.
