## Questions
1. What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?

The issues should be broken up into smaller sections then proceed with troubleshooting them individually. 

2. What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?

You should create a plan of action before implementing the solution.

3. What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?

It helps with faster issue resolution, knowledge sharing/retention, and historical tracking.

4. Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background?

Helping someone troubleshoot their Apple Watch that's not syncing to their iPhone. Identifying if there's a particular app that the end user uses normally that is not syncing. Establish a theory as to maybe the app hasn't been updated on either device. Testing the theory by getting permission to update the devices. Establish a plan of action by having them back up their data to the cloud just in case you have to do a factory reset. Implement the plan. Verify with the end user that the app or apps are syncing and walk them through steps to fixing the issue.
