## Why this topic matters:

SOP's help govern the workplace in order to ensure that all employees are on the same page. 

## Questions: 

1. What is a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), and why is it important for an organization?

 It's a procedure that is specific to your company or organization that describes the activities necessary to complete a particular task.


2. What are the three types of documents that should be included in an SOP manual? Briefly describe each type.

Policy- “Why?” Provides broad, overarching guidance.
SOP- “What, when, and why.” What needs to be done, when does it need to be done, and why is it being done. There may be multiple SOPs that support a specific policy.
Work Instructions- “How.” A work instruction (WI) provides the step-by-step directions for accomplishing a particular task. There may be multiple sets of work instructions that support a specific SOP. 

3. Why are SOPs considered a primary way to implement or enforce policies in an organization?

They are a primary way to implement or enforce a policy. They're important because the policies help the organization work towards the mission, vision, and goals. 


4. What does the author emphasize regarding the audience when writing SOPs, and why is it essential to consider them?


5. Imagine you are a part of a multicultural team responsible for following an SOP. How would you address potential misunderstandings or differing interpretations of the procedure due to cultural differences? Propose strategies to foster effective cross-cultural communication.


In my experience, the most effective way of interpreting an SOP to a coworker is by finding way to relate the SOP to their cultural upbringing and seeing things from their own perspective.
