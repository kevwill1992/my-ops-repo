## Why this topic matters:

Command line tools are important due to sever administration, rapid troubleshooting, scripting, automation, and efficiency. 

## Questions:

1. How can you list the files in the current directory using the command prompt?

dir 

2. How might the “sfc” command and the “gpupdate” command help in troubleshooting on Windows?

The sfc command can detect and replace corrupted or missing system files that may effect applcation errors. The gpupdate command can help update permissions, security policies, and other configuration. 

3. What advantages does the “robocopy” command offer over the “xcopy” command, and why is it useful for file transfers in certain situations?

Command-Line flexibility, support for long paths, and logging and reporting. 

4. Think about any real-life scenarios from your cultural context where the use of command line tools could be beneficial. Describe one such scenario and explain how a specific command line tool would help address the situation.

The sfc command in my previous role would be extremely useful. My job required that I maintain constant communication with aircrews in flight via radio or chat. There were times that the chat application would suddenly crash and I wouldn't be able to reopen the application. At the time, I had absolutely no clue how to troubleshoot the issue so I would either call a tech to fix the issue or restart the computer.


## Things that I want to know more about:

Are there any bootcamps for command-line tools?
