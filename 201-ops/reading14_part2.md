# Reading 14: Psychological Safety

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

Trust, inclusion, learning/growth

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

I was previously part of a team of audio technicians for a small business. The team was responsible for developing and maintaining a critical piece of infrastructure that was used by the entire company. The team was composed of highly skilled and experienced technicians, but the psychological safety on the team was not very high.

One of the main reasons for this was the team's manager. The manager was very demanding and had a high standard for performance. He was also quick to criticize team members for mistakes, even small ones. This created a culture of fear and anxiety on the team. Team members were afraid to speak up about their ideas or admit their mistakes, which stifled innovation and collaboration.

Another factor that contributed to the lack of psychological safety on the team was the team's culture. The team was very competitive, and team members were often pitted against each other. This led to a culture of secrecy and mistrust. Team members were afraid to share their ideas or collaborate with each other, because they didn't want to be seen as falling behind.

Despite the lack of psychological safety, the team was still able to produce high-quality work. However, I believe that the team could have been even more successful if the manager had focused on creating a more psychologically safe environment.

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

Increased innovation, creativity, productivity, and performance.
