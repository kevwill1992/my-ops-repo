Imagine you're throwing a party at your house, and you want to make sure everything runs smoothly and securely. The SOC2 pyramid is like the foundation for a successful and secure party.

SOC2 Foundation - Policies and Procedures:

Analogy: Think of this as creating the ground rules for your party. Before the guests arrive, you establish policies and procedures. These are like the house rules: where guests can go, what they can do, and how to behave. These policies are the backbone of your party's success, ensuring order and safety.

SOC2 Middle Layer - Communication and Awareness:

Analogy: Now that you have your ground rules in place, you need to make sure everyone is aware of them. This is like sending out invitations and putting up signs around your house. Communication and awareness ensure that your guests know what to expect, where to go, and what's off-limits. It's about spreading the word and keeping everyone on the same page.

SOC2 Top Layer - Monitoring and Enforcement:

Analogy: During the party, you need to keep an eye on things to make sure everything is going according to plan. This is similar to having security guards and hosts who monitor the guests and enforce the rules. If someone is causing trouble or violating the policies, they need to be addressed. Monitoring and enforcement ensure that your party stays secure and enjoyable for everyone.
