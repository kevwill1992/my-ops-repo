### Why this topic matters and how it relates to what I'm studying:
The importance of this topic revolves around the risks of our adversaries being able to take full advantage of our weaknesses and not having any idea that it's happening. Also, that even the most prominent companies with high-end infrastructures can be susceptible to malicious attacks.  

1. How is a hardware hack different than a software hack? A hardware hack is the exploitation of the phycial components of a device. A software hack is the exploitation of security within the operating system of a device.
2. What are the two ways for spies to alter a computerâ€™s hardware? Interdiction and Seeding
3. Explain how the hack worked: The microchip manipulated the operating instructions while the data was being moved. As the bits of the operating system was being stored in temporary memory, the positioning of the chip allowed it to edit the information and inject its own code to change the instructions of the CPU.
4. How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source? Investigators followed Supermicro's suppy chain in reverse by the serial numbers on the motherboards that traced back to specific factories. In addition, they uttilized communication intercepts, informants, and tracked individuals through their phones.
