3. Explain how the hack worked: The microchip manipulated the operating instructions while the data was being moved. As the bits of the operating system was being stored in temporary memory, the positioning of the chip allowed it to edit the information and inject its own code to change the instructions of the CPU.
4. How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source? Investigators followed Supermicro's suppy chain in reverse by the serial numbers on the motherboards that traced back to specific factories. In addition, they uttilized communication intercepts, informants, and tracked individuals through their phones.
