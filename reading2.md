## Why this topic matters
Building a computer can alot more cost-effective than buying a pre-built desktop or gaming laptop depending on your needs. Extensive researching and proper budgeting can save you some money in the long term as well as having the freedom to customize and optimize your computer the way you want. 

1. Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need? If you're building a high-end gaming PC, the more cores are better and you should stay around six cores. Higher speed is better if you want to process data faster.
2. What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor? Checking the sock of the CPU and motherboard, onboard Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, multiple RAM slots/high RAM capacity, support for graphics
3. What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device? Physical size of the hard drive to ensure that it fits in your case so possibly using an M.2 drive instead of HDD. Price is another trade-off, so depending on your budget, possibly going with and SDD instead of an M.2 drive. 
4. Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with? The CPU is your brain where all of your thinking takes place. RAM is where you tend to experience short-term memory loss. The hard drive is where you remember key events that you haven't forgotten for years. The motherboard is what connects all of the internal components of the body together. The graphics card is sort-of-like your eyesight. It's the difference between having to wear glasses or not. The power supply is your heart/nervous system so it keeps a constant flow of electricity support the body. The case is the body that protects all of the internal components. The cooling system helps regulate the body's internal temperature.
