## Why this topic matters
The BIOS can be found in every computer system so having a firm understanding as how to access, navigate, and troubleshoot issues with the operating system and hardware is essential. 

## Questions

1. What is the BIOS? The Basic Input/Output System is a program that loads the operating system when the computer is powered on. It's responsible for initializing and configuring various hardware compontents during the boot process. 

2. Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process? The best way I can describe the booting process would be comparing it to my stint as a production technician for live events. It was my job to make sure that we had the proper lighting, audio, and video equipment so essentially I would be considered as the POST. Making sure that all of the equipment such as the sound boards were updated and compatible with the speakers, lighting rigs were able to support the lights, and any video walls/screens were within standards and could be supported in the venue. If for any reason the venue couldn't support essenstials such as proper power or space for the stage, then it was on me figure out how to reconfigure the stage or get additional power in order to make the show function.

3. What is the “Power On Self Test”? It's the power supply unit that cheks the system's internal hardware and components for compatibility, connection and ensures that no errors exist before loading the operationg system.

4. What is the CMOS? The CMOS is used to store critical data used by the operating system during the booting process.

5. What is the CMOS  battery? The CMOS battery is used to supply power to the CMOS RAM which stores user settings and other data required during the booting process.
