## Why this topic matters
As a cybersecurity professional, tranferring files between systems in an secure and safe manner for companies is extremely important.  

## Questions

### SSH Protocol

1. What is the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol?
A method for secure remote login from one computer to another. It provides several alternative options for strong authentication, and it protects communications security and integrity with strong encryption.

2. What are the typical uses of the SSH protocol?
Provides secure access for users and automated processes, interactive and automated file transfers, issuing of remote commands, manages network infrastructure and other mission-critical system components.

3. How does the SSH protocol work?
The protocol works in the client-server model, which means that the connection is established by the SSH client connecting to the SSH server. The SSH client drives the connection setup process and uses public key cryptography to verify the identity of the SSH server. After the setup phase the SSH protocol uses strong symmetric encryption and hashing algorithms to ensure the privacy and integrity of the data that is exchanged between the client and server.


4. How is the data kept safe when transmitted between the SSH client and server?
Data transmitted between the SSH client and server is kept safe through a combination of encryption and cryptographic techniques.

5. What is SFTP?
Secure File Transfer Protocol and it is a network protocol that provides a secure way to transfer files between a client and a server over a network. It is often used when managing remote servers or transferring sensitive files.

### RDP

1. What is Windows Remote Desktop Connection?
Gives users the ability to connect to a remote Windows PC or server over the internet or on a local network, giving them full access to the tools and software installed on it

2. What is RDP?
The Remote Desktop Protocol allows remote users to see and use Windows on a device in another location.


3. What is the RDP port number?
3389


## Things I want to know more about

Are newer protocols being developed?
