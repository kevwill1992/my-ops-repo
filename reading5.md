## Why this topic matters


## Questions

1. Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?

2. What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?
cd, ls, & mv
3. What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?
A relative path specifies the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory. They are shorter and less specific. An absolute path specifies the complete path from the root directory and are useful when you need to reference a specific location regardless of your current working directory. The tilde is a short hand representation of the user's home directory. The foward slash is used to separate directory and file names in a path. It is also used as a root directory in an absolute path. 
4. Explain what Linux is, using anything except English.
