# Reading 8: RADIUS Authentication

## Computer Network- Authentication, Authorization, & Accounting


1. Explain each of the three Aâ€™s as you would to a non-technical family member. Use an analogy or a story.

Authentication is about confirming identity, like a secret handshake.
Authorization is about deciding what areas or resources someone can access, similar to granting room access in a clubhouse.
Accounting is like keeping a record of who accessed the network and what they did, just like keeping a notebook of visitors to the clubhouse.


2. What should the administrator do if the ACS server fails to authenticate a user during AAA implementation?

The administrator should mention using the local database of the device as a backup, in the method list, to implement AAA. 

3. What is the role of the NAS in the AAA implementation using an ACS server? Use a diagram.

## RADIUS Concepts:

1. What are the benefits of using RADIUS for authentication and authorization?

RADIUS provides a robust and flexible solution for managing user authentication and authorization in a networked environment, offering benefits such as centralization, enhanced security, scalability, and integration capabilities.

2. What is RADIUS and what does it stand for?

RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) is a networking protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) management for users who connect and use a network service.

3. Research: What encryption algorithms does RADIUS use?

The RADIUS client uses the MD5 algorithm to encrypt the user password. The RADIUS server uses a symmetric encryption method
